Syed Salman Rahman</h1>
<p>
Hi! I am Salman. I was always determined to build a portfolio for myself that protrays diverse and deep technical competencies, engineering skillsets and as well as my leadershsip attributes.
I got into engineering because I always loved to take challenges of solving engineering connundrums.

From high school years I have been balancing between theories, hands-on-skills and execution. While I worked on multiple projects made from Arduino, GSM Module, ESP shields and hundreds of sensors
  and competed in different competions I also have been involved in many leadership roles in different clubs and organizations. 

In my undergraduate years, I involved myself with Research by working with two different research groups on multiple projects. I successfully managed to co-author 2 conference and 1 journal paper from these projects. I have also served as a Teaching Assistant for the two terms of 2017 (Spring 2017 and Fall 2017) for the course Signals and Systems.
  
 <p>My fields of expertise are:  <b>IoT, Communication, Networking, Signal Processing, Temperature Profile, Microfluidics, Data Analytics, Bluetooth Low Energy.</b></p>
